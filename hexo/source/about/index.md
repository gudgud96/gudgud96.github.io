## About Me

Hao Hao Tan (郑豪好) - from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, residing in Singapore.

I am a software engineer at [BandLab Technologies](https://www.bandlab.com/), working on audio core and machine learning for music applications. Before BandLab, I worked on:

- main feed recommendation architecture at [TikTok]();

- music content recognition at [Fairphonic](https://fairphonic.com/), a startup focusing on music royalties solution;

- controllable music generation at [SUTD Audio, Music and AI Lab](https://dorienherremans.com/team) with Prof Dorien Herremans.

I also do independent research on the side, mainly on the intersection of music information retrieval and machine learning. Some topics that I work on recently are [synthesizer parameter inference](https://github.com/gudgud96/syntheon) and [differentiable wavetable synthesis](https://github.com/gudgud96/diff-wave-synth).

Sometimes I make some weird beats - you can check them out at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/gasifymusic).
