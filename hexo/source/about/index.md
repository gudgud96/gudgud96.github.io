## About Me

Hi there! My name is Hao Hao Tan (郑豪好), or you can call me Harry. I am from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and currently residing in Singapore.

I am a machine learning engineer at [BandLab Technologies](https://www.bandlab.com/), applying AI/ML to assist music creation workflow (such as [SongStarter](https://www.bandlab.com/songstarter)). I mainly work on MIR topics such as music generation, transcription, auto-tagging, etc., and I also work on more engineering-sided stuffs such as on-device model serving.

My experience revolve around technology that empowers music / creative applications. Before BandLab, I was a backend engineer at [TikTok](), working on the deep ranking module of TikTok's main feed recommendation architecture. I also worked at a music tech startup called [Fairphonic](https://fairphonic.com/), which tackles the issue of music royalties payout, and I helped build a deep-learning based music content recognition engine that can identify both originals and covers.

Outside of my day job, I also work on some independent research / open-source projects. Some of my projects are:
- [Syntheon](https://github.com/gudgud96/syntheon), a parameter inference model for [Vital](), a wavetable synth; 
- [frechet-audio-distance](https://github.com/gudgud96/frechet-audio-distance), a lightweight library for Frechet Audio Distance calculation.
- [PyTorch implementation of differentiable wavetable synthesis](https://github.com/gudgud96/diff-wave-synth).

I am a classically trained pianist, but sometimes I make some weird electronic beats - you can check them out on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/gasifymusic).
