## About Me

Hi there! My name is Hao Hao Tan (ÈÉëË±™Â•Ω), or you can call me Harry. I am from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and currently residing in Singapore.

I'm currently at [BandLab Technologies](https://www.bandlab.com/), working on applying AI/ML to assist music creation workflow, such as [SongStarter](https://www.bandlab.com/songstarter), [Audio-to-MIDI](https://blog.bandlab.com/introduction-to-bandlab-beta-features/#voicetomidi), [Smart MIDI Tools](https://help.bandlab.com/hc/en-us/articles/37479760983833-What-are-Smart-Tools), [Splitter](https://www.bandlab.com/splitter), etc. I work with a broad range of MIR topics, and I recently focus more on ML engineering topics like [on-device model serving](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/ondevice_learning/ondevice_learning.html) and [optimization](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/optimizations/optimizations.html).

My experience revolves around technology that empowers creative applications, mostly in music. Before BandLab, I was at [TikTok]() working on the deep ranking module of TikTok's main feed recommendation. I also worked at a music tech startup called [Fairphonic](https://fairphonic.com/), which tackles the issue of music royalties payout, and I helped design and build a deep-learning based music content recognition engine that can identify both originals and covers.

I also work on some independent research / open-source projects, such as:
- [Syntheon](https://github.com/gudgud96/syntheon), a parameter inference model for synths; 
- [frechet-audio-distance](https://github.com/gudgud96/frechet-audio-distance), a lightweight library for Frechet Audio Distance calculation.
- A PyTorch implementation of [differentiable wavetable synthesis](https://github.com/gudgud96/diff-wave-synth).

I am a classically trained pianist, sometimes I make [weird electronic beats](https://soundcloud.com/gasifymusic/alkaloid). About my music palette üé® - I grew up listening to [Hong Kong Cantonese classics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq6gZBTwPFk&list=PLLlhPNUoErKZ9j6QEWn1NvGzuQsXX6LUt&ab_channel=mtvprogress2012), learnt about [English pop hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE5DiniY45w&ab_channel=MohammedTalas) and [IU](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mq5yxPd_9TeLuoeFq-noTqyiC8KTwsvjU) during school. Now I like pure instrumental or electronic stuffs - [Rush Garcia](), [TheFatRat](), [Vicetone](), [Glacier](), [Avenza](), [Ë£ÅÁºùÈì∫](), and recently [Drics](). Probably [Paramore]() and [Imagine Dragons]() would be two of the biggest exceptions.
