## About Me

Hi there! My name is Hao Hao Tan (郑豪好), or you can call me Harry. I am from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and currently residing in Singapore.

I'm currently at [BandLab Technologies](https://www.bandlab.com/), working on AI-assisted features to enhance music creation workflow. You can have a look at a list of our projects [here](https://www.bandlab.com/ai). We make a bunch of cool stuffs for music making, such as *SongStarter*, *Voice Changer*, *Splitter*, *Smart MIDI tools* (Copilot for MIDI), *Audio-to-MIDI*, etc. On the nerdy side, I also work on ML engineering topics like [on-device model serving](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/ondevice_learning/ondevice_learning.html) and [optimization](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/optimizations/optimizations.html) -- some of the features above run directly on users' mobile device!

My experience centers on <u>technologies that enable creative applications</u>. While studying at NTU Singapore, I wrote my bachelor's [thesis](https://www.computationalcreativity.net/iccc2019/assets/creative-submissions/iccc19-tan-chordal.pdf) on AI music generation using deep learning (LSTMs at the time). This work led to a presentation at the ICCC conference and, after graduation, a position as a research assistant in Prof. Dorien Herremans’ lab, where I focused on controllable music generation and audio synthesis. I later joined a music tech startup called [Fairphonic](https://www.fairphonic.com), where I developed a deep learning–based music content ID system capable of identifying both original tracks and cover versions to improve royalty attribution. Before joining BandLab, I worked at TikTok on the deep ranking module of its feed recommendation system.

Sometimes I also work on independent research / open-source projects, such as:
- [Syntheon](https://github.com/gudgud96/syntheon), a parameter inference model for synths; 
- [frechet-audio-distance](https://github.com/gudgud96/frechet-audio-distance), a lightweight library for Frechet Audio Distance calculation.
- A PyTorch implementation of [differentiable wavetable synthesis](https://github.com/gudgud96/diff-wave-synth).

I am a classically trained pianist, and I listen to all kinds of music (Cantonese classics, IU, Rush Garcia, TheFatRat, Vicetone, Glacier, Avenza, 裁缝铺, Drics...). If you are looking for some cool music, feel free to listen to [**these playlists**]() that I made!
