## About Me

Hi there! My name is Hao Hao Tan (鄭豪好) from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

I worked as a research assistant under the [Audio, Music, Affective Computing and AI team](http://dorienherremans.com/team) (AMAAI) at Singapore University of Technology and Design. 

My research interests include controllable deep generative models on music, and music information retrieval. I hope to study how machine learning techniques could be brought from research to production, and be applied in practical means within the music industry.

I earned my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science major at Nanyang Technological Univesity, with previous internship experiences at PayPal, [Visenze](https://www.visenze.com/), and [DSAIR @ NTU](https://dsair.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx).

Music wise, I do piano accompaniment, songwriting, music production, and session work as a keyboardist. I am super keen in collaborations on all kinds of music projects, do hit me up if you wanna have fun together!

My resume can be found [here](../Resume_2020.pdf).
