## About Me

My name is Hao Hao Tan (郑豪好), or you can call me Harry. I am from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and currently residing in Singapore.

I currently work on AI-powered features at [BandLab](https://www.bandlab.com/) to enhance music creation workflow, e.g. *SongStarter*, *Voice Changer*, *Splitter*, *MIDI tools*, *Audio-to-MIDI*, *Similar Sounds*, etc. I also work on [on-device model serving](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/ondevice_learning/ondevice_learning.html) and [optimization](https://mlsysbook.ai/contents/optimizations/optimizations.html) -- some of the features above run directly on users' mobile device!

I'm passionate about building technologies that <u>enhance creative applications</u>. My [bachelor's thesis](https://www.computationalcreativity.net/iccc2019/assets/creative-submissions/iccc19-tan-chordal.pdf) was about a chord-based music generation system using LSTMs. Then, I worked on controllable music generation and audio synthesis at [Prof. Dorien Herremans' lab](https://dorienherremans.com/team). I later joined [Fairphonic](https://www.fairphonic.com) and built a deep learning–based music content ID system (originals and covers included!) to fix issues on rights attribution. Before joining BandLab, I did backend engineering at TikTok on its (massive) feed recommendation system.

Sometimes I work on independent research / open-source projects, you can find them on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/gudgud96). I'm generally interested about topics related to audio, synthesizers, (fun ways of) search & retrieval, and small on-device models.

I am a classically trained pianist, and I listen to all kinds of music ranging from [Cantonese classics](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ExJszOInX2i1J2UQ4hNCF?si=9wStJzo9QamSbTpWvD9CqQ), [Edvard Grieg](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0XkyuCwxp8EtnDZ5VNieS1?si=e1bc1592aa1549a3) to [pure electronic beats](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5NlawbBDGkH8W9SblamHZO?si=7zFP3AFjSWq8Bbpf1PhvQQ). Stay tuned for [**some awesome playlists**]() that I made.
