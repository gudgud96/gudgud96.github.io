## About Me

Hao Hao Tan (郑豪好) - from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, residing in Singapore.

Currently I am working on **recommendation system architecture** at **TikTok**. My main challenge is to evolute and optimize TikTok's RecSys architecture to be leaner and more efficient, to support the ever-growing load brought in by immense DAU. 

Before TikTok, I built cover song detection systems at [Fairphonic](https://fairphonic.com/), a tech startup focusing on music royalties solution. I also worked on controllable music generation during my time at the [Audio, Music and AI Lab](https://dorienherremans.com/team) at SUTD, led by Prof Dorien Herremans.

I am mainly interested in music tech, deep learning, and scalable ML systems. I work on MIR projects as an independent, and recently I focus more on DDSP, efficient music synthesis and cover song detection.

I completed my Computer Science bachelor’s degree at Nanyang Technological University, with previous internship experience at [PayPal]() and [ViSenze](https://www.visenze.com/).
