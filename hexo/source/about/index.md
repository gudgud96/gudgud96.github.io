## About Me

My name is Hao Hao Tan (郑豪好), or you can call me Harry. I am from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and currently residing in Singapore. I am currently an AI & Audio Scientist at [Universal Music Group](https://www.universalmusic.com/), a member of the Music and Audio Machine Learning Lab (MAML).

I'm passionate about building technologies that **enhance creative applications**. My journey started with my [thesis](https://www.computationalcreativity.net/iccc2019/assets/creative-submissions/iccc19-tan-chordal.pdf) for my Computer Science degree at NTU Singapore, about a chord-based music generation system using LSTMs. Some work I did before UMG: 

- Built some fun [AI-powered features](https://www.bandlab.com/ai) at [BandLab](https://www.bandlab.com) to help budding musicians with their creative workflow;
- Worked on the (massive) feed recommendation system at [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com);
- Built a deep learning–based music content ID system, originals and covers included, for a music startup called [Fairphonic](https://www.fairphonic.com).

Sometimes I work on independent research / open-source projects, you can find them on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/gudgud96). I'm generally interested about topics related to creativity, audio, (fun ways of) search & retrieval, and small on-device models.

I am a classically trained pianist, and (I think) I have a wide palette when it comes to listening music, ranging from [Cantonese classics](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ExJszOInX2i1J2UQ4hNCF?si=9wStJzo9QamSbTpWvD9CqQ), [Edvard Grieg](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0XkyuCwxp8EtnDZ5VNieS1?si=e1bc1592aa1549a3) to [pure electronic beats](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5NlawbBDGkH8W9SblamHZO?si=7zFP3AFjSWq8Bbpf1PhvQQ). I love building my own playlists, [see here](https://linktr.ee/gudgud96) if you are interested.
