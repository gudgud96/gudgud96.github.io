## About Me

Hao Hao Tan (郑豪好) - from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, residing in Singapore.

I am a software engineer at **TikTok**, working on the **ranking module architecture** of TikTok's main feed recommendation. My scope covers system optimization, ML serving infra for deep ranking models, and site reliability engineering. 

Before TikTok, 

- I worked on **music content recognition** (much like [Youtube Content ID](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en)) at [Fairphonic](https://fairphonic.com/), a tech startup focusing on music royalties solution

- I also worked on **controllable music generation** at the [Audio, Music and AI Lab](https://dorienherremans.com/team) with Prof Dorien Herremans, focusing on [emotion-based music generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15474)

I am mainly interested in music tech, deep learning, and scalable ML systems. My recent focus is on DDSP-related topics (in particular [differentiable wavetable synthesis](https://github.com/gudgud96/diff-wave-synth)), efficient audio synthesis, and scalable cover song detection.

I completed my Computer Science bachelor’s degree at Nanyang Technological University, with previous internship experience at [PayPal]() and [ViSenze](https://www.visenze.com/).
